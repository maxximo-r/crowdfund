CrowdFunding refers to the behavior of public individuals to use different internet technologies and digital platforms in contributing and support of individual project and innovations. The platform being proposed to develop in this project is a CrowdFunding platform that create a easier, open source, and more reliable gateway for fund providers to contribute to the financing of a promising project started by an innovative creator who lacks sufficient resources for generating such content. Also, one of its main roles is to create a link that will bridge the gap between viable project ideas and successful implementation. For the development of this project we will start understanding the main concept of modern digital Crowdfunding, the influence on the current market and the local implications of such. To reach this goal we will implement a plattaform using a pre-existent open source blog placeholder WordPress and an already designed scheme generating funcionalities and mechanics to create an open source solution integrated into a blog service to work as a fully indepented and self hosted CrowdFunding platform solution.
